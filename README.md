Multimedia Database Management System

INTRODUCTION: 
A multimedia database management system is a framework that manages different types of data 
potentially represented in a wide diversity of formats on a wide array of media sources. 
 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: 
The multimedia DBMS provides support for multimedia data types and facilities for the creation, 
storages, access, query and control of the multimedia database. 
 
FEATURE: 
1.   Since multimedia objects are typically huge, we need different techniques for their storage 
and retrieval. Multimedia objects can be stored in different systems and users might access 
stored  data  over  computer  networks.    This  leads  to  a  distributed  view  of  multimedia 
databases. 
2.  Users  can  query  multimedia  databases  in  different  ways,  depending  on  the  type  of 
information they need.  These queries provide a filtered view of the multimedia databases to 
the users by retrieving only the required objects.   
3.  The objects retrieved from the databases have to be appropriately presented, providing the 
userâ€™s view of the multimedia database. 
Here some components describes in details: 
 
1.  Text Data 
a)  Text data is often represented as strings.However, text as used in multimedia 
document systems includes structural information such as title, author etc. 
b)   Hence one needs a language environment to reflect the structural composition of the 
text data. c)  Another environment named the Hypermedia/Time-based structuring language has 
also been defined to include support for hypermedia documents with links and 
support for inclusion of multimedia object in a text documents specification. 
 
 
2.  Audio Data 
a)  Audio data has an inherent time dependency associated with it.The time scale 
associated with audio object has to be uniform for a meaningful interpretation. 
b)  Audio has to be digitized before it can be processed. Size of digitized audio depends 
on the technique used, which in turns depends on the desired audio quality. 
c)  For instance, a normal voice quality  digitization is done at 8khz with 8bits per 
sample and hence it produces 64kb/s of data. 
 
3.  Image Data 
a)  Image data represent digitized drawing, painting, or photographs.The size of a 
digitized image depends on the required quality. 
b)  Color image and photograph requires more storage space.Typically a color image  or 
a photograph needs the RGB components of each pixel to be stored. 
c)  Different compression algorithms as well as storage representations can be employed 
and this results in different formats of digitized images and photographs. 
d)  Joint Photographers Encoding Group (JPEG) is one such format for images, which 
has been standardized by ISO. 
e)  Other  popular  formats  include  Graphic  Interchange  Format  (GIF)  and  Tag  Image 
Format (TIFF). 
 
4.  Video Data 
a)  Video data represents the time dependent sequencing of digitized pictures or images 
called video frames. 
b)  The  number  of  video  frames  for  one  second  depends  on  the  standard  that  is 
employed. c)  NTSC (National Television System Committee) standard employs 30 frames/second 
while PAL (Phase Alternation Line) employs 25 frames/second. 
d)  Further,  the  pixel  size  of  a  frame  depends  on  the  desired  quality.    Normal  NTSC 
frames  are  512  *  480  pixels  in  size,  HDTV  (High  Definition  Television)  frames 
employ 1024 * 1024 pixels. 
e)  The  number  of  bits  needed  per  pixel  reflects  the  quality  of  digitized  video  frame.  
Digitized  video  requires  large  storage  space.    Compression  schemes  need  to  be 
employed to reduce the volume of data to be stored.   
f)  Motion Picture Encoding Group (MPEG) is a standard that has been specified by the 
ISO  for  compression  and  storage  of  video.    The  standard  MPEG  2  specifies  the 
methodology for storing audio along with compressed video. 
 
CHALLENGES: 
When we can understand our project clearly then we will be able to take any kind of challenges. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
From this we can conclude that the database management for multimedia is required and it can 
be managed like normal data that will very helpful in the current era of multimedia application. 
Number of multimedia database system already exists with some limitation but we can expect 
new system with better capabilities in the near future. Future trend include performing indexing , 
retrieval and browsing  directly on the compressed data , especially for video data; video data 
management; multimedia query language ; uniform indexing frame work for the different data 
types; content base image and video retrieval; and multimedia transport and  deliver overt the  
internet.
